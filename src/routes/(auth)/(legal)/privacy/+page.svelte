        078 900 86 66<br/>christina.benz@stud.fhgr.ch<br/><br/><strong>General / Introduction</strong><br/>Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the data protection provisions of the Federal Data Protection Act (DSG), every person is entitled to the protection of their privacy and protection against the misuse of their personal data. The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the legal data protection regulations and this privacy policy.<br/><br/>In collaboration with our hosting providers, we strive to protect databases as best as possible from unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration.<br/><br/>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating via email) can have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.<br/><br/>By using this website, you agree to the collection, processing, and use of data as described below. This website can generally be visited without registration. Data such as pages accessed or names of accessed files, date, and time are stored on the server for statistical purposes without this data being directly related to your person. If personal data (e.g., name, address, or email addresses) is collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as possible. This data will not be disclosed to third parties without your express consent.<br/>
        <br><strong>Scope and Purpose</strong><br>
        MovieMate is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows users to create a watchlist of movies. This can be done in two ways: either by discovering new movies or by manually adding movies. However, the main purpose of the PWA is for users, along with their friends who also use MovieMate, to find movies that everyone will enjoy.<br>
        <br/><strong>Processing of Personal Data</strong><br/>MovieMate is a platform that processes personal data as part of registration and use. Personal data includes all information that relates to an identified or identifiable person. The following explains how MovieMate processes personal data:<br/><br>
        1.	Registration: To use MovieMate, users must register. During registration, personal data is collected, especially email addresses. The email address serves as an identifier and allows users to log into their account. <br><br>
        2.	Legal Basis: MovieMate processes personal data in accordance with Swiss data protection law. If the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies, processing is based on the legal grounds specified in Art. 6 (1) of the GDPR. This includes, among other things, processing based on the consent of the data subject. <br><br>
        3.	Purpose of Data Processing: The collected personal data, especially email addresses, are used for user identification and the provision of personalized services on MovieMate. This allows users to manage their watchlists and share movies with friends. <br><br>
        4.	Duration of Data Processing: MovieMate stores personal data for the duration necessary for the respective purpose(s). If there are longer retention obligations due to legal requirements, the data will be restricted accordingly. <br><br>
        MovieMate is committed to treating personal data confidentially and protecting it in accordance with applicable data protection regulations. The provision of email addresses during registration is solely for the purpose of enabling user identification and providing the platform's functions. Data will not be disclosed to third parties without the consent of users. <br>
